# PRODIGY_CS_01
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## Caesar Cipher
This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in a text is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features
#### Encryption: 
  Shifts each letter in the input text by a specified number of positions.

For eg: If i give "abc" and shift value 4, "a" will become "e" and like this for "b" 
and "c". so final output will be "efg".value of "a" will be shifted by 4 and it become "e"

#### Decryption: 
  Reverses the shift to retrieve the original text.

For eg: if i give input "efg" and shift value 4 then,
it will decrease "e" by 4 and it will become "a" and output of "efg" will "abc".

## Usage
Run the Program: Execute the Python script and follow the prompts.

User Input:                                                                                                                                                                          
Choose to encrypt or decrypt.                                                                                                                                                              
Enter the message.                                                                                                                                                                    
Enter the shift value.
